					Hi Guys Im Dave,<br/><br/>
					
					And I am committed, or should be committed for building this wacked out site. I built this site for the Trades in Ontario. 
					This is a site where you can smoke a joint,  have a beer,  play some tunes and relax.<br/><br/>
					
					Im also  going to build you your own network, in your city or town, whether you like it or not. This way no one, will run out of work. 
					This site will be your site, your place to go when the wife gets mad at you, for washing her delicates with the boat cover. Were also holding a monthly poker 
					tournament.  Were giving away New trucks, Motorcycles , a Giant Hulk, Golfing and Fishing packages,  Custom Golf carts, SEX DOLLS, (yes sex dolls), and 
					some of the coolest stuff on the planet.. In the mean time the prize board will grow pretty fast.  Could be a classic Car,  And yes the sex dolls are real... 
					You might even win a giant 20 ft. Dinosaur. It all depends on how much I drink on prize night.  If your coming here to try and win a giant 20 ft. dinosaur , 
					you my friend, have a gambling problem.  You guys can post pictures, you can create your own Ad. Im also going to try to get us complete dental insurance. 
					This site will eventually connect you all.  But don't get upset if some guy wins a sex doll, because you didnt register.  And your still sitting at home ,  
					putting lipstick and false eyelashes on your pre drilled watermelon..  Its completely up to you...<br/><br/>
					Your going to miss a lot... So join us. There is strength in numbers...
					Lets just say , Chicks n Cars and Mad Magazine...That's what were about...
					Only for the trades in Ontario...
