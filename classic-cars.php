                        Guys like cars., Gals Too... These are the kinds of cars I grew up with.. A lot of my friends had cool cars. 69 Chevelle. 1968 Mustangs, My friends had great cars... Whereas my family had cars from hell... My sister had a yellow Gremlin, which we called the giant banana. My Mother had the exploding Pinto.. She was always offering us a ride to school, but we told her its only seven miles to school. We will walk... And my Dad had the LTD. The Boat as they called it.. It wasn't big enough for him ... So he decided to weld two of them together... His only problem was parking...
